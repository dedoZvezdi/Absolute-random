# Absolute-random
SOOOOOOoooOoOo I don't know how will work in the end, date_on_start (~21~22.12.2024), but i am trying to create a library that is NOT
some pre-writed random numbers but return alway a random integer or string still don't know how i will make it and what will happened.
But for now TEST. As a 👍normal👌❤️ programar i will do some time test how fast and my idea in the begging will work(probably will change mid code).
