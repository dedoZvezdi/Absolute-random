# Absolute-random
SOOOOOOoooOoOo I don't know how will work in the end, date_on_start (~21~22.12.2024), but i am trying to create a library that is NOT
some pre-writed random numbers but return alway a random integer or string still don't know how i will make it and what will happened.
But for now TEST. As a 👍normal👌❤️ programar i will do some time test how fast and my idea in the begging will work(probably will change mid code).
If you want to test will me first found a dragon eye only red and the left one on the right side or just download Test/test/RNG folder -> [It's for me NOT for you i will know if you click, you go and download it the hard way.
